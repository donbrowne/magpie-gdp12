Obstacles
1. Ensuring all dependencies have been satisfied for the application
 has led to a technically complex installation procedure.
 Mitigation: Streamline the process using scripting and by improving
 the quality of the install document.
2. Our knowledge model no longer works and needs to replaced ASAP by a
 proper rules based inference engine.
 Mitigation: The new rewritten engine is currently being integrated
 into the next release.
3. Lack of documentation surrounding features of the application and
 some unintuitive layout has made it difficult for both testers and
 clients to find and assess the features.
 Mitigation: Improve the quality of the documentation surrounding
 features.  Improve the design layout in places where confusion is
 judged to arise.
