#summary A description of Magpie features

= 1.0 Introduction =

This page contains some details about accounts, basic user instruction information and an overview of Magpie features for administration.


= 2.0 Guest and User Accounts =

When a user visits the site they are provided by default with guest level access to features.

Users can register with the site in order to utilise some additional features for saving the last recommendations and providing profile specific lines of questioning.
Users register accounts by clicking on the link along the top menu banner and then supplying username, password and email address.
Users may modify their account, from the link along the top menu banner, to modify the account details.
Users may select a profile type to help tailor recomendations.  
A registered users last questions and recommendations session is saved by system.


= 3.0 Basic Client User Instructions =

From the "Welcome" screen click the start button to begin a questions and recommendation session.
Under "Questions" answer by selecting with the yes/no radio button and clicking Next.
"Questions" will then display any follow up questions on the left or change to "All Done" if there are no more follow up questions.

Recomendations inferred from the answers to previous questions are listed on the right.
Recomendations can take various formats such as PML, images, links to websites embedded video etc.

When "All Done" is displayed there is a button underneath labeled "Done".
This "Done" button saves the line of questions recommendations to the user profile (not available for guests).
User profiles may save one line of recommendations at a time (and will overwrite the old one with a new line of questions).


= 4.0 Administration Interface =

When an admin logs in to the Magpie administration interface the Magpie site admin Home screen is displayed which gives a system overview.  
The overview is broken down into four sections: Auth (authorisation), Knowledge, Register and Sites.


== 4.1 Auth ==

Auth(authorisation) is utilised to manage Magpie administration rights at group and account level.

Contains two subsections: Groups, Users. 
Various permissions can be specified relating to how a unique account or accounts belonging to a particular group can interact with the system.


== 4.2 Knowledge ==

Knowledge is where you can create recommendations, upload multimedia content and specify rules of inferrence to tailor recommendations to users.

Contains four subsections: Recommends, Resource files, Rule sets, Variables.


=== 4.2.1 Recommends ===

This section contains the list of the set of recommendations that have been input.
The process of having the user answer questions allows a subset of recommendations to be generated from this list and displayed to the user.
Clicking on the button "Add recommend" opens a window to allow you to input details for a given recommend.
  * Recommends must consist of an identifying name, some descriptive text.  
  * Optionally they can have a PML model, Video file or other multimedia link attached from resources stored on the Magpie server.
  * Optionally they can also have external links attached (along with some required descriptive text for the link) e.g. linking to an internet site.
Once satisfied with all the details you will need to choose one of the save options along the bottom menu banner to complete the "Add recommend" process.
In this manner you can build up a list of all the various different recommendations which are served based on the inference rules,
as specified in "Rule sets"(see details below).

_Notes:_ 

  * _Video links (in the recommends) to resources hosted locally on the Magpie server) must be in FLV format. Users must convert the FLVs themselves as we feel that conversion on our end is outside the scope of requirements._
  * _External links to streaming video such as youtube get embeded automatically._
  * _Any links to images get embedded on the web page._


=== 4.2.2 Resource files ===

This section allows you to upload resource files to the Magpie server for attaching to the recommendations.

  * You must specify a description of the resource for ease of administration.
  * You must specify a local path to the file (or simply click the button "Browse..." and select the file).
  * Restricted files - tick the box, and the file can only be accessed by an admin, maintainer, or user who has the view restricted files permission.  You can also select users from the list to be allowed.

Once satisfied with all the details you will need to choose one of the save options along the bottom menu banner to complete the "Add resource file" process.

Additionally you can edit any exsiting resource files as well as view any historical edits to them.


=== 4.2.3 Rule sets ===

This is where you may create multiple rule sets to govern which information is asked of users and which recommendations are presented to them.

A users profile is associated a rule set to determine which questions are posed to the user.  Thus different user profiles may be posed different sets of questions to get different recommendations from the same knowledge base.

The button "Add rule set" allows you to specify a list of rules which are run in order starting at Rule 1.  Rule sets need a name to identify them for administration.

The button "Add Rule" will launch a UI form that allows you to add an inference rule(s) to the rule set.

Rules take the form of premises setting conclusions and yielding recomendations: 

Premise(s) -> Conclusion(s) => Recommendation(s)

  * You can add multiple premises to ask the user questions that set the values for variables.
  * Premises are aggregated with a logical AND operation to determine if a rule fires.
  * Conclusions may then fire in order to set the value of further variables.
  * The associated recommendations are presented to the user when the rule fires.

The order in which the rules are fired can be changed from the GUI by dragging and dropping with the <|> arrows icon on the left of the X icon.

Once rules are added to the rule set is it necessary to choose one of the options to save along the bottom banner menu.


=== 4.2.4 Variables ===

The variable values we are interested in are both yes/no answers to questions posed to users as well as values inferred from answered questions.

Variables can be added with the button "Add variable" (Home->Knowledge->Variables).

Variables require a "Name:" to identify them to the Admin system and a "Prompt:" which is typically the text of a question that we pose to a user.

There is a tick box labeled "Ask" which determines whether or not the variable is asked of a user.  We may not want to ask a user about a variable if we intended on inferring the variables value with a conclusion.  In this sort of case it is probably best to set the "Prompt:" to something sensibly descriptive.


== 4.3 Register ==

Register administration consists of sections Profiles and Accounts.


=== 4.3.1 Profiles ===

Profiles are created with a profile name and associated with a rule set.
Profiles may have variables set to specific default values by adding Profile answers.


=== 4.3.1 Accounts ===

Accounts lists all user accounts registered on the system and displays which profile is assiciated with each account.


== 4.4 Sites ==

<to be added later>
