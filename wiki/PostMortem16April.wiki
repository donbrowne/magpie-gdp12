Obstacles
1. Feedback from Release 1 received a couple of days before Release 2 due to go gold.  Mitigation: Best efforts were made to incorporate these ideas into Release 2 before deadline.
2. Getting unit test coverage for the applicable functions was not really fully understood as a high priority until feedback received.  Mitigation: Lots of extra effort above and beyond the amount of time this module should have gotten was put into getting
3. This effort at unit test coverage was possibly at the expense of some user interface changes we would have liked to have implemented in the final product. Mitigation: There was no mitigation for not having time at the end to do some general UI usability improvements. We simply did not have the resources available to throw at the problem.
