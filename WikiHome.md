# Introduction #

Magpie - Model Advice Guidance Process Intergration Explorer.  A software system specifically designed for knowledge management of information relating to software processes. Magpie is hosted on a server and can be accessed and administered from a web browser. When configured, Magpie will ask users a series of yes/no questions and based on this can infer a list of recommendations for the user. Recommendations that provide the process modeling information can contain a mix of various multimedia formats such as images, video, rendered PML models, hyperlinks etc.
