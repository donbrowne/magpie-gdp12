INITIALIZING TEST SERVER -

From your OS shell, cd to the django_mapgie directory, and enter the following -

python manage.py runserver

This will start a webserver and will inform you of the address. It is usually -

http://127.0.0.1:8000/

UNIT TESTING -

When the server has been started as per the previous instructions, run -

python helloWorldUnitTest.py

The test will ensure that the server works, and that it has the expected message, it assumes the server is running at the default address.
