INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

From the magpie directory (or trunk, if pulled from svn) run -

chmod +x *.sh


--IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UBUNTU 10.04/10.10 USERS -
--Due to the age of the Ubuntu 10.04 package set, it is necessary to use
--a third party repository to supply an updated version of Python. Thus,
--it is also necessary to run
    sudo ./setup_tenfour.sh
--to set up Python 2.7 and Django 1.3 
--This process will also automatically install Graphviz and pydot. Once
--the script is run, the following command should be used instead of 
--'python' for starting initializing the Django application -
    python2.7
--and all additional Python modules should be installed with -
    sudo easy_install-2.7 <module name>
    
For users not running Ubuntu 10.04 or 10.10, the dependencies need to be
manually installed. A list will be specified in accompanying docs.

All users must then run -

./setup.sh

On the first run of the application, it is necessary to cd to the 
django_magpie directory, and run -

python manage.py syncdb
cd .. 
sudo chown -R www-data resources/ sqlite3/

Where www-data is the Apache user for Ubuntu. This username varies from 
distribution to distribution, consult the OS documentation if in doubt. 

CONFIGURING APACHE

NOTE:
The exact method of configuring Apache varies from one Linux 
distribution to another. The following method is used to configure 
Ubuntu 10.04 and 10.10 For other distributions, the OS documentation 
should be consulted.

The following shorthand will be used in this section. Any time you see 
these mentioned, substitute for the appropriate value -

PATH - The path to the magpie-gdp12 folder in the installation tarball
        or the magpie-gdp12-read-only folder if pulling from svn.
HOST - The hostname of your computer
NAME - The subdomain where you want the site to run. If have no
        preference, you can choose whatever you want for this name.

First off, the hostname for the site must be configured. With your text
editor of choice, open /etc/hosts as root. Insert -

127.0.1.1  NAME.HOST

Some distributions require a fully qualified hostname, in which case -

127.0.1.1 NAME.HOST.localdomain NAME.HOST

This assumes that the Apache installation is set up purely for testing.
If your computer has been configured as a production web server, you 
will need to change the IP and 'localdomain' to match the rest of your
configuration.

In the folder with this documentation, you will find a file named 
apacheConfig. Assuming that the docs folder is the current directory, 
run -

sudo cp apacheConfig /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/NAME

Open this file with your text editor of choice as root. For all 
occurences of PATH, HOST and NAME, substitute them for the appropriate 
values.

Next, in your django_magpie folder, you will find a script named 
magpie.wsgi Open this file and substitute PATH for the value of PATH as
described above.

Now run -

sudo a2ensite NAME
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload

The site can now be accessed at NAME.HOST

If you wish to use Django's manage.py runserver for hosting the site,
note that you will need to take care of hosting the media and static 
files, and configuring settings.py as appropriate.
